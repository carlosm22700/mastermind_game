# TODO
Implement guess history
Better error handling:
    -correct inputs only:
    -game goes over 10 guesses and does not end session.
    -try a better way to display or log game condition? win/lose etc...
clean up views/refactor
-ability to end game. will be reused for session ending as well for different reasons (10 guesses/loss) or exit. 
-implement user?
